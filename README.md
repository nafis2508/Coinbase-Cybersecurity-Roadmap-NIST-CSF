Coinbase Cybersecurity Roadmap Report (NIST CSF v1.1)

This repository contains my final submission for ACCG8086 – Cybersecurity, Governance Frameworks and Ethics (Macquarie University, 2025 Session 2).

The report develops a full cybersecurity roadmap for Coinbase, using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF v1.1) to analyse the 2023 smishing attack and the 2025 insider bribery/extortion breach. It integrates governance frameworks, policy enforcement, and cultural reforms to recommend a comprehensive resilience strategy.

📘 Project Overview

Title: Cybersecurity Roadmap for Coinbase Using the NIST CSF

This project investigates how Coinbase suffered two major breaches—a 2023 social engineering attack and a 2025 insider bribery incident—and evaluates how the NIST CSF could have prevented or mitigated both events.

The analysis focuses on five core areas:

Identify: Risk mapping, governance gaps, supply chain weakness

Protect: Access control, MFA, awareness training, protective technologies

Detect: SIEM, anomaly detection, continuous monitoring

Respond: Playbooks, communication structures, escalation

Recover: Compensation, transparency, metrics, trust rebuilding

The report integrates scholarly literature, industry reporting, and course frameworks across governance, ethics, policy, and organizational culture.

⚖️ Key Insights

Governance Gaps: Weak contractor oversight, unclear accountability, and insufficient supply chain controls.
Human & Cultural Weaknesses: Psychological safety issues, under-reporting, inconsistent training engagement.
Technical Weaknesses: Limited anomaly detection, late recognition of insider data exfiltration, over-reliance on manual monitoring.
Policy Issues: Lack of enforced SysSPs, insufficient MFA controls, and inadequate incident playbooks.
Strategic Lesson: Security resilience depends on aligning governance, culture, and technology under the NIST CSF.

🧩 Frameworks & Tools Used

NIST CSF v1.1: Identify → Protect → Detect → Respond → Recover
Governance Frameworks: ISO 27014, COBIT
Policies: EISP, ISSP, SysSP
Culture & People: Psychological safety, communication climate, supervisory accountability

🧠 Lessons Learned

This project shows that effective cybersecurity requires more than technology. Sustainable resilience demands:

Strong governance and defined accountability

Embedded cultural practices that support vigilance and reporting

Proactive monitoring and anomaly detection

Clear policies supported by regular training

Recovery processes that rebuild trust internally and externally
